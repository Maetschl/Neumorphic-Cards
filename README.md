# Neumorphic Cards

Based on the blog post [Neumorphism in user interfaces](https://uxdesign.cc/neumorphism-in-user-interfaces-b47cef3bf3a6)

## Standard Button

The first button has only the Neumorphic style, but keeps the normal behaviour of a button when tapped. 

## Selectable Button

The Neumorphic Selectable ButtonStyle will keep the state once selected. It is constructed to toggle its colors in order to achive a good affordance and feedback.

## Tappable Button

The Neumorphic Tappable ButtonStyle only flashes the color toggling. Also designed with affordance and feedback in mind.

Build using Xcode 11.5
